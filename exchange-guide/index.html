            <h1 id="background" class="mt-5 mb-4">Background</h1>

            <p>Herbaria in Australasia have transferred data in several formats
                in the last 10–20 years. Following the release of HISPID, it was
                common for herbaria to export and import HISPID version 3 or 4
                data files. More recently, herbaria have used the herbarium
                community’s BioCASE providers to serve HISPID 5 data, or
                generated Darwin Core-based spreadsheets and CSV files. All but
                2–3 Australian herbaria now support the exchange of data in
                Darwin Core. In New Zealand, the standard has been Darwin Core
                for several years.</p>

            <p>With the availability of HISPID 6 (an extension of Darwin Core)
                and the availability of many other Darwin Core extensions, it is
                time to consider what a modern, efficient method of data
                transfer looks like for the Australasian herbarium
                community.</p>

            <p>Australasian herbaria are faced with challenges in 2020 that
                can’t be met with our current exchange protocol. This includes
                the need for permit and unique agent data, a revision to the way
                type data is exchanged and a decision on how herbaria formalise
                the link between duplicate specimens and the way this data is
                exchanged.</p>

            <p>Data exchange using <strong>HISPID version 3 and 4</strong>
                formats suffer from several issues:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>There are no permit fields in this standard, which precludes
                    it from being used if an herbarium needs to send Nagoya
                    Protocol data.
                </li>

                <li>There are no fields in this standard for the transfer of
                    unique URIs for collectors and identifiers of specimens.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Data exchange using <strong>HISPID 5</strong> format, which is
                based on ABCD 2.06, suffers from several issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The file format is complex, making it more difficult for
                    under-resourced institutions or very small herbaria to
                    exchange data.
                </li>

                <li>There are no fields in this standard for the transfer of
                    unique URIs for collectors and identifiers of specimens.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The <strong>limitations of current exchange formats</strong> also
                include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Plain CSV and other delimited text files do not specify a
                    character set, making it difficult to determine how the file
                    should be read correctly to preserve diacritical marks.
                    Additionally, there is no way to formally signal that the
                    end of the document has been reached (other than reaching
                    the end of the document). This is an issue for network data
                    transfer because it is not always clear whether the transfer
                    ended prematurely. (These problems affect the CSV files in a
                    Darwin Core CSV file too, but we will explain how to correct
                    this later.)
                </li>

                <li>While XML stipulates a character set and defines the end of
                    a document, it is excessively verbose. This makes it both
                    difficult to create without the help of software (a problem
                    for small institutions) and excessively large in file size.
                </li>

                <li>HISPID versions before 5 are no longer suitable for use, as
                    there are no permit fields in these standards. This
                    precludes them from being used if an herbarium needs to send
                    Nagoya Protocol data. There is additionally no way to
                    specify a character set as part of the data file.
                </li>

                <li>Data exchange in HISPID 5 (ABCD 2.06) format is no longer
                    suitable for use because there is no support for Collector
                    IDs. Additionally, the file format is complex, making it
                    more difficult for under-resourced institutions or very
                    small herbaria to exchange data. It also slows the rate of
                    adoption of changes to exchange processes in larger
                    institutions.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>A <strong>Darwin Core Archive</strong> provides the following
                features:</p>

            <p><strong>Ease of use</strong>: A Darwin Core Archive comprises one
                or more CSV files containing columns of data using Darwin Core,
                HISPID 6, GGBN and other terminology as noted in this document.
                A CSV file is easily created, even by hand, if necessary. In
                comparison, XML is difficult to create and is usually only
                managed through software.</p>

            <p><strong>Comparatively small archives</strong>: By adopting CSV, a
                file is small when compared to the equivalent output using XML
                and BioCASe.</p>

            <p><strong>Up-to-date terminology</strong>: By adopting a term-based
                vocabulary based on Darwin Core and HISPID 6, we gain access to
                recent terminologies, including ABCD 3.</p>

            <p><strong>Comparatively easy extension when a new property needs to
                be exchanged</strong>: By adopting vocabularies (HISPID 6,
                Darwin Core, ABCD 3, GGBN) rather than a document schema (HISPID
                5, ABCD 2.06), it is easier to add a new property to an exchange
                archive. </p>

            <p><strong>Typed data</strong>: Darwin Core Archive’s metafile
                provides metadata about the CSV files in an archive. This
                includes a character set for the data files and the type of data
                that is being provided in each row and column of each CSV.
                Additionally, a Zip file comes with its own protection against
                premature end of file errors. These mostly avoid the problem we
                identified earlier with CSV data files.</p>

            <h1 id="resourcing" class="mt-5 mb-4">Resourcing</h1>

            <p>Institutions that use this MoU to exchange data should (a) be
                able to export the data <em>for each property</em> into an
                exchange document and (b) be able to import the data <em>from
                    each property</em> in the exchange document into local
                systems. These basic requirements will ensure that it will
                eventually possible to accurately exchange provenance,
                collector, type, and permit data between herbaria. Once this
                occurs, it also becomes possible for institutions to be notified
                when these properties of a linked specimen are changed by
                another institution.</p>

            <p>There is a resourcing issue for an institution to make changes to
                its file exchange protocols to allow it to take part in the
                revised exchange protocol. Some work will be required to
                determine a mapping between the local institution’s collection
                database and the terms in this MoU and it may be necessary to
                hire external consultants to do this. The cost of this work is
                dependent upon the ease of access to the required data, the
                availability of staff with the skills needed to complete the
                work, the need for external consultants and the fees they
                charge.</p>

            <p>Many herbaria already have the capability to generate and
                exchange documents of this kind and there is a general push for
                the developers of collections management software such as
                Specify to be more closely involved in the need for Darwin Core
                support.</p>

            <h1 id="terms" class="mt-5 mb-4">Terms</h1>

            <p>The terms included in this MoU are those in the
                <a href="https://github.com/hiscom/business/blob/master/mou-technical-addendum.md">
                    AVH MoU Technical Addendum (2020)</a> plus the following
                additional terms.</p>

            <h2 id="permits">Permits</h2>

            <p>The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing establishes an
                obligation on signatories—including Australia—to document the
                terms of any agreement an institution has made for the use of
                genetic resources. The details of permits granted when
                collecting plant specimens must be shared with other
                institutions so that there is legal clarity for ongoing use of
                herbarium specimens for duplicate specimens. To support the
                transfer of permit data, we adopt the
                <a href="https://wiki.ggbn.org/ggbn/GGBN_Data_Standard_v1#GGBN_Permit_Vocabulary">GGBN
                    Permit Vocabulary</a>, and in particular Darwin Core’s <a

                    Permit Extension</a>. </p>

            <p>In the AVH MoU Technical Addendum, only <code>permitStatus</code>
                is necessary for AVH, and any terms included in the data sent to
                ALA are automatically displayed to the public. As permit data
                identifies a person by their permit number, this data is
                sensitive and must be treated like other kinds of private data.
            </p>

            <p>For herbarium exchange, we must provide a repeating set of the

            <p>The specimen or specimens that a taxonomist uses to describe and
                name a new species is a type specimen. These are the most
                important specimens in a collection.</p>

            <p>For AVH, we exchange type information using
                <a href="https://hiscom.github.io/hispid/terms/#typeStatus"><code>typeStatus</code>
                </a> only, but in herbarium exchange it is preferable to
                separate some of that data for easier consumption by also using
                <code>typeOfType</code> from HISPID 6.</p>

            <p>The identity of the people who collected or identified a specimen
                are important to the taxonomic process. Unfortunately, there is
                immense diversity in the way humans represent names.
                Additionally, a person’s name and its representation can change
                over time.</p>

            <p>For example, there are many ways to refer to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_von_Mueller">Ferdinand
                    von Mueller</a>: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Ferdinand Jakob Heinrich von Mueller</li>
                <li>Baron Ferdinand von Mueller</li>
                <li>Ferdinand von Müller</li>
                <li>F.J.H. von Mueller</li>
                <li>F.Muell</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Identifying the collectors and identifiers of specimens using
                unique identifiers makes it possible to disambiguate people with
                similar names as well as check for errors. Several identifier
                standards now exist to uniquely represent a person in a
                scientific setting including ORCID, Wikidata and VIAF.</p>

            <p>All variation in the way <strong>Ferdinand von Mueller</strong>

                    <p>GBIF has begun supporting unique identifiers for
                        collectors by introducing a draft change to its
                        infrastructure. The change allows them to accept a
                        <code>recordedByID</code> term alongside the standard
                        Darwin Core <code>recordedBy</code> term. This new term
                        is to contain unique identifiers for each collector
                        listed in the <code>recordedBy</code> term in the same
                        order. GBIF does not make a recommendation about which
                        identifier standard to use, but HISCOM recommends using
                        one of the standards listed above.</p>

                    <p>This term is used in the core occurrences file, and its
                        value must be a pipe-separated (<code>|</code>) list of
                        absolute URIs consistent with the examples listed above.
                    </p>

                    <p>Some research staff, especially those with a historical
                        or high profile will commonly already have a Wikidata or
                        VIAF ID, and these should be reused rather than
                        generating an ORCID ID for them.</p>
